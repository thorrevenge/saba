The park has undergone some major improvements over the last few years including the opening of The Yowah General Store. The store is a small supermarket with fresh fruit & veg, meat, frozen food, ATM and hardware. It has fuel & LPG and is also the local post office. This was a major addition to the business and well received by the locals (saving them traveling 300k round trip).

With the onset of the tourists in the winter months, business has been increasing rapidly each year and the general store has added additional profits, grossing around $600,000 - $650,000 per annum. Currently run by a husband and wife team along with some casual staff, allowing the owners to take holidays in summer. This gives a great healthy lifestyle balance.

HISTORY:
Springvale Station was established in 1879 by Alfred Giles as part of Dr Browne's Northern Territory pastoral empire. The complex includes the homestead, store, Ronan family grave site and the immediate surrounding grounds to the river's edge.
The homestead was built in 1879 and was completed later the same year. Springvale was one of the first two substantial homesteads built in the Katherine region and the only one which remains.
The homestead and station also has associations with the Territory's commercial and agricultural development, World War II and Australian literature. Springvale was the head station and base for Dr Browne's pastoral interests in the Northern Territory. Stations which were established and stocked from Springvale included Delamere, Willeroo, Newcastle Waters and Bonrook under the overall management of Alfred Giles.
Springvale was also the central point for travellers passing between Darwin, South Australia and Queensland. During World War II the property became an Aboriginal labour settlement under joint Military and Native Affairs Branch control.
In 1949 George Hunt sold the home to noted Australian writers Tom and Moya Ronan. It was from here that Tom Ronan contributed some of his most noted literary works. (NT Government Heritage Register).

Construction is complete, the retail spaces on the ground floor are being filled and very few residential units are vacant.
The property: The Developer is ready to move forward to another project and has enlisted Ray White Commercial Northern Corridor Group to present five, two bedroom units all of which are well appointed and completed with top of the line fixture and fittings including air conditioning. All five units are tenanted or have twelve month rental guarantees attached to them. Each unit is a generous 74m2 and comes with an exclusive & secure car space. The building itself comprises twenty four two bedroom units and five retail units facing Whites Rd. An internal lift and staircase connects the foyer to the upstairs dwellings.
The numbers: Lease them as whole units or capitalise on the location. Petrie Station and the new multi million dollar University of the Sunshine Coast campus are located at the end of the road providing the perfect opportunity to lease the rooms individually as university accommodation. The current setup will provide an income of $85,800 per annum. However conversion to student accommodation makes the sky the limit.
The location: As the first new project under construction in the Mill Central Precinct of The Mill Priority Redevelopment Area, this project is centrally located in the heart of the Petrie Town Centre as well as the proposed future Mill Central area envisioned by the Moreton Bay Regional Council (please request Due Diligence Pack to view all council planning for the area and 'The Mill' development already under construction across the road). Current projections are a requirement to accommodate 10,000 students by 2030 growing to 20,000 at full operation. It is needless to say the capital growth on this investment will far exceed expectations.

THE VAULT | A STATE-OF-THE-ART NEW BUSINESS PARK - THE NORTH WEST is one of Sydney's fastest developing regions, the North West Corridor is experiencing unprecedented demand for industrial space.
THE VAULT delivers a state-of-the-art new business park to service this rapidly transforming area. THE VAULT encompasses 76 industrial strata lots with two components available for both sale and lease - industrial business units and storage units.
THE VAULT | INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS UNITS
The Vault industrial business units encompass ground floor warehouse/showroom space along with mezzanine office space, lending them to an exceptionally diverse variety of business opportunities. They range in size from 217-273 sqm (GLA), with larger opportunities if combined together. Some include outdoor terraces.
THE VAULT development features an expansive sandstone facade, giving it a striking street presence and individuality.
THE VAULT | STORAGE UNITS with 24/7 ACCESS
The Vault storage units are ideal for tradies, import/ export businesses or as a man cave' for enthusiastic tinkerers or wine collectors in need of additional space. They're also perfect for boat and caravan storage. They range in size from 26-63 sqm (GLA) plus hardstand.
THE VAULT | STATE-OF-THE-ART AMENITY
Safety and security is a primary focus of The Vault, with 24/7 access available and video surveillance for peace of mind. Finishes are high quality, three-phase power is available to all units and the park is serviced by an on site café.
THE VAULT is zoned Light Industrial, the project is due for likely completion in 2020, with anticipations that investors will see net rental returns of 6-7% (warehouse).
When the Sydney Metro high-frequency railway opens, scheduled for the second quarter of 2019, accessibility to the North West region from the city and southern suburbs will be substantially enhanced. The Vault is a short bus ride from Rouse Hill station along the forthcoming rail line, making it ideally located to benefit from this important infrastructure project. Once complete, a trip to the CBD will take 55 minutes (including interchange) to Wynyard Station, reducing to 46 minutes from 2024.
The nearby Rouse Hill Town Centre is a major retail, dining and entertainment hub, providing excellent amenity for local businesses. A new public hospital has also been approved for Rouse Hill, with The Vault perfectly positioned to support this new medical precinct and the many business opportunities it will bring.
